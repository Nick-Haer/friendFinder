# friendFinder
This dating app is built in node with the use of express. It is intended to demonstrate knowledge of express routing, node, and the general ability to connect a functioning backend to a functioning front end.

This project went fairly well, but was not especially interesting, except for the logic used to find the user's closest match, and the techniques to display a modal with the proper information. This was the first full stack web app I'd made as a project, and though the application was relativley basic, it was enjoyable to see it all coming together. For me, the hardest section of this project was getting all the routing figured out properly, though it was quite rewarding when the routes finally meshed.

This project used the following technologies:


* Bootstrap
* Jquery
* Node
* Express
* Heroku



Check out a photo of the app working below. The photo demonstrates a user succesfully finding their match. If the image link input by the match doesn't work, then it will instead display some text consoling the user.
